Try clicking on the **Preview** URL inside this comment. You should see the changes you just made.

When you have a pull request open, Vercel automatically creates a **preview deployment** for that branch on every push. The preview URL will always point to the latest preview deployment.

You can share this preview URL with your collaborators and get immediate feedback.

If your preview deployment looks good, **merge it to** `main`. When you do this, Vercel automatically creates a production deployment.
